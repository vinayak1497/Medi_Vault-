## 🎯 FEATURE CAPABILITIES

### What the AI Assistant Can Do

**Patient asks:** "What medications am I taking?"

**System processes:**
1. Recognizes patient: Vinayak Kundar
2. Fetches prescriptions from Firebase
3. Finds: Amoxicillin 500mg (Dr. Ashok Patil)
4. Fetches medical info
5. Includes: Allergies: Aspirin, Peanuts
6. Formats context
7. Sends to Gemini with patient data
8. Returns personalized response:

```
"Hi Vinayak! 👋

Based on your prescription from Dr. Ashok Patil, 
you're taking Amoxicillin 500mg, twice daily for 7 days.

⚠️ Since you're allergic to Aspirin, avoid aspirin-based 
pain relievers. Take this with food.

Feel free to ask more questions! 💚"
